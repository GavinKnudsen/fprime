## Getting Started With F´

To get started with F´, install the F´ bootstrapping tool with:
```
pip install fprime-bootstrap
```
Then, create a new project with:
```
fprime-bootstrap project
```

See the [HelloWorld Tutorial](https://fprime-community.github.io/fprime-tutorial-hello-world/) to guide you through all the steps of developing an F´ project.

New users are encouraged to read through the [User Guide](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/UsersGuide/guide.html) and explore the [other tutorials](../Tutorials/README.md).
